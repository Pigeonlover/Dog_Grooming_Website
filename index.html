            <h2>We Are Open Again!</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you very much to everyone's patience! The renovations at our premises are now
                fully completed, and we are open for business again. We are very excited to show our
                customers and their furry companions the new place!

            <h2>Temporary Closure</h2>
            <p>
                Wet Paws will close for a couple of months as we are planning to renovate and 
                redecorate the place. All previous appointments will be fulfilled, but we won't
                accept any new bookings. We are hopeful we will be finished in January!
            </p>

                As the festive season draws closer, here at Wet Paws we want to wish all our
                customers and their pets a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! We hope to
                see everyone again soon and give your animals a special treatment!
